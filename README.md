# Superstore-Dataset-Analysis
Performance analysis of Superstore Dataset, Kaggle Dataset Analysis –  OWL Internship Task

This repository contains the analysis of a Kaggle dataset as part of the OWL Internship project.
The goal is to derive key insights from the data using tables, visualizations, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), and summarize findings in a report.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn


##  Dataset

The analysis uses the **Superstore Dataset – Final** from Kaggle:

- **Link**: [vivek468/superstore-dataset-final](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)

**To reproduce the analysis**:
1. Download the dataset from the Kaggle link above.
2. Place the file (e.g., `Sample - Superstore.csv`) into a local directory.
3. Run the notebook `Internship_OWL.ipynb`.


## 📂 Files
- `Internship_OWL.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full EDA and visuals.
- `Superstore Dataset Analysis Report.pdf` – PDF report summarizing insights from the notebook.
- `README.md` – This documentation.


## 🚀 How to Use

- Clone the repository:
  - git clone https://github.com/ernest717/Superstore-Dataset-Analysis.git
    
**Ensure data is placed in the same folder as the notebook**
- Open the notebook:
  - jupyter notebook Internship_OWL.ipynb with either Jupyter notebook or VScode

Run the cells to reproduce the analysis.
